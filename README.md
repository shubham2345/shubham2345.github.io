### Advancing Web-Based Visual Question Answering with Efficient Text Alignment
[To be published in Springer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zGYiLEjOg1Y8kgOhoJcjmnC0cq0Cn4Zt/view?usp=sharing)

This paper is a contribution to WebQA, a recent benchmark by Microsoft that combines visual and text reasoning for answers. Exploring alternatives to WebQA's baseline models like vision language pre-training (VLP) models, my aim was to enhance accuracy through (a) a lighter model, (b) detector-free visual encoder, and (c) knowledge distillation methods such as RoBERTa. Comparing VLP and RoBERTa on single and multi-source questions revealed **RoBERTa's superior performance at 54.91% and 30.11%, respectively, compared to VLP's 51.49% and 28.73%. This research serves as an advancement to Bing Search**.

### Extraction of Cumulative Blobs from Dynamic Gestures
[Publication](https://www.worldwidejournals.com/international-journal-of-scientific-research-(IJSR)/recent_issues_pdf/2021/September/extraction-of-cumulative-blobs-from-dynamic-gestures_September_2021_1606633349_6832750.pdf)

In this project, we're diving into the world of gesture recognition, a game-changer in the way we interact with computers. Imagine controlling your computer without the need for a mouse or keyboard – that's the magic of gesture recognition. But here's the catch – it struggles in low-light conditions due to its reliance on cameras. To tackle this, we got creative and introduced a night vision camera. It's like giving our system a pair of night-vision goggles, making it thrive where others struggle. We've set up a Raspberry Pi with OpenCV, teaching it to spot and track dynamic gestures. With the help of a nifty machine learning algorithm, we're now recognizing patterns and seamlessly controlling the Raspberry Pi's GPIOs for various tasks. Guess what? We've hit an impressive **99.62% accuracy**, proving that even in the dark, our gesture recognition system shines bright.

[Publication](https://www.ijsr.net/getabstract.php?paperid=MR21824001401)

Incorporated the K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, the system assesses the similarity of unknown entities or users through past ratings, providing a robust foundation for collaborative filtering. It extends the capabilities of the Collaborative Filtering Algorithm to span multiple categories. The resulting recommendation system stands out for its adaptability and accuracy, offering personalized suggestions across diverse categories and criteria.

## Projects
### Number Plate Detection and Recognition

The project 'Number Plate Detection and Recognition' aimed to create an automatic number plate detection pipeline, covering detection, localization, and extraction of car number plates from input images. Initially utilizing the YOLO real-time object detection model, there was a recognized need for improved recognition capabilities, leading to the seamless adoption of the ImageAI framework. The hands-on experience in implementing car and number plate recognition on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano using Python showcased technical proficiency and strategic optimization. The achieved results include a groundbreaking **98% accuracy in car detection, 97% accuracy in number plate detection, and 96.7% accuracy in Optical Character Recognition**, emphasizing a commitment to excellence in computer vision applications.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question Answering on a document

This project aimed to create a responsive Question-Answering (QA) system for swift data interactions, delivering precise responses within 3 seconds. Utilizing a simplified Retrieval Augmented Generation model with ROBERTA, challenges such as similarity scoring and ambiguity resolution were addressed. The user-friendly interface, developed with Streamlit, facilitated seamless interactions. Elasticsearch served as a versatile storage solution for various document formats. The project successfully integrated efficient storage, heuristic methods for ambiguity resolution, and an intuitive user interface for optimal data interaction and rapid response delivery.


### Extract Skill Entities from a resume using Named Entity Recognition

 The primary objective was to craft a tailored Named Entity Recognition Model (NER) using spaCy. The expedition traversed vital prerequisites, encompassing annotated data and user-friendly tools like the NER Annotator for spaCy. To streamline PDF text extraction, an ingenious Python script leveraging PyPDF2 was developed. The project's evolution involved meticulous steps, including environment setup, spaCy configuration, data processing, and model training. This undertaking contributes valuable insights and practical guidance for enthusiasts venturing into the dynamic landscape of NLP and personalized NER model creation.
