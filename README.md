- Created an application ProCreate File Validator, Quality Check Framework (QC) that validates the security data received from custodians and a preprocessor to the ETL process
- Developed an ETL wrapper to the Aladdin Loading Engine named CDI Persister Converter converting complex data structures (unrectifiable post-validation) into suitable formats for loading

## Publications
### Advancing Web-Based Visual Question Answering with Efficient Text Alignment
[Publication in Progress in Springer Journal] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zGYiLEjOg1Y8kgOhoJcjmnC0cq0Cn4Zt/view?usp=sharing)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Multi-Category and Multi-Criteria Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering
[Publication](https://www.ijsr.net/getabstract.php?paperid=MR21824001401)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.


## Projects
### Number Plate Detection and Recognition

The project 'Number Plate Detection and Recognition' aimed to create an automatic number plate detection pipeline, covering detection, localization, and extraction of car number plates from input images. Initially utilizing the YOLO real-time object detection model, there was a recognized need for improved recognition capabilities, leading to the seamless adoption of the ImageAI framework. The hands-on experience in implementing car and number plate recognition on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano using Python showcased technical proficiency and strategic optimization. The achieved results include a groundbreaking 98% accuracy in car detection, 97% accuracy in number plate detection, and 96.7% accuracy in Optical Character Recognition, emphasizing a commitment to excellence in computer vision applications.
